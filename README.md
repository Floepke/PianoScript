# PianoScript
PianoScript is a music notation which is displaying a midifile in such way that it is readable as music notation. You can print the midifile to learn to play it on the piano. PianoScript is based on the klavarskribo music notation but has multiple differences. I am seeing that many people are using midifiles to learn to play a piece on the piano. For example think about synthesia(the pianoroll on youtube). And I am one of these people but I have a problem to solve: 

### Midifiles are not very human readable!
I mean that a midifile in the pianorolleditor is not easy to read, therefore they are using colors. But for this music notation the rules are to use only the color black. With black you can also use grey which I am doing. Look to the 'design' file which is displaying a 'hand drawn' example.

### PianoScript in a nutshell
PianoScript is based on klavarskribo(google it if you wanna know how it looks). Unlike klavarskribo PianoScript is read from left to right and uses greyscale rectangles to point out the beats. The staff is basically a miniature piano keyboard drawn as staff. The lines do mean the black keys, it are groups of two and three lines. On top and in between are the piano notes written as circles. The fill of the note is the same as the color of the piano key which makes after a few hours of practice much sense. The rhythmic notation works like a piano-roll editor in distances. The greyscale grid tells you how many beats there are and of course there are clear black barlines. 

### advantages and disadvantages
Advantages:
* You don't have to learn about sharps and flats
* very visual design
* There is only one way to write a note so that makes it possible to convert a midi correctly.
* there is no key signature because the staff is twelve tone

Disasvantages:
* the rhythmic notation is less clear, however sometimes it can be helpfull to have a hard rhythmic phrase in distances.
* PianoScript gives no context about scales. this however can also be a advantage...
